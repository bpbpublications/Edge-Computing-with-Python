Deep Dive into Edge Computing and its Implementations

This is the repository for [Edge Computing with Python
](https://bpbonline.com/products/edge-computing-with-python),published by BPB Publications. 

## About the Book
The success of IoT and Industry 4.0 depends on edge computing and better network performance. The book, ‘Edge Computing with Python,’ intends to provide a fully-connected embedded environment in which readers can experience the applications of edge computing and IoT in a professional context.
 
In this book, readers will learn what edge computing is, what its possible applications are, and how advantageous it is. This book provides thorough instructions for using Python to build every potential edge application. The book begins by configuring the programming environment with tools like VS Code, Python, and several popular libraries like SciPy, NumPy, and Pandas. Then, the book explains gaining access to IO devices, data handling, data storage, cloud connectivity, and hosting ready and pre-trained machine learning models step by step. 
 
The book delves into sophisticated ideas such as Docker Containers, MQTT, and FIWARE and how one can use them to construct Edge applications. In addition, the book details the Siemens Edge computing platform and how to use it for rapidly developing Edge applications. After reading this book, knowledge of Edge Computing's architecture, its benefits, and drawbacks will give readers a competitive advantage in the market.
